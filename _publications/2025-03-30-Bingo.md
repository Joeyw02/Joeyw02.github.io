title: "BINGO: Radix-based Bias Factorization for Random Walk on Dynamic Graphs"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2025_Bingo
excerpt: 'This paper presents Bingo, a GPU-based random walk engine designed for dynamic graphs. Unlike existing systems that struggle with updates, Bingo supports both fast streaming updates and high-throughput batch updates. To achieve this, the authors propose a radix-based bias factorization for constant-time sampling, a group-adaption method to save space, and GPU-friendly designs for efficient updates. Experiments show that Bingo significantly outperforms previous methods, with up to 271× speedup on various tasks and datasets.'
